# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo CLI Core Functionality

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation checks completed successfully

**Notes**:
- Specification defines 5 user stories with clear priorities (P1 and P2)
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-014) are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Acceptance scenarios are comprehensive with Given-When-Then format
- Out of scope section clearly delineates Phase I boundaries
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for unspecified details
- No clarification needed - all requirements are clear and well-defined

**Ready for next phase**: `/sp.plan` (Implementation Planning)
