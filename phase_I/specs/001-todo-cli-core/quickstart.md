# Quickstart: Todo CLI Application

**Purpose**: Get the Todo CLI application running and test basic functionality
**Date**: 2026-01-01

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher installed
- Access to terminal/command line
- `pytest` installed for running tests (optional)

## Installation

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd todo-cli-app
```

### (Optional) Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

No external dependencies required for Phase I. Only standard library used.

To run tests (optional):

```bash
pip install pytest
```

## Running the Application

### Start Application

```bash
python src/main.py help
```

This displays all available commands and usage examples.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Add Your First Task

```bash
python src/main.py add "Buy groceries"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Task created successfully.
ID: 1
Title: Buy groceries
Status: Incomplete
```

### 2. View All Tasks

```bash
python src/main.py list
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Your Tasks:

[ ] 1: Buy groceries
```

### 3. Add Another Task with Description

```bash
python src/main.py add "Write report" --description "Quarterly sales report"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Task created successfully.
ID: 2
Title: Write report
Description: Quarterly sales report
Status: Incomplete
```

### 4. View Tasks Again

```bash
python src/main.py list
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Your Tasks:

[ ] 1: Buy groceries
[ ] 2: Write report (Quarterly sales report)
```

### 5. Mark Task as Complete

```bash
python src/main.py complete 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Task marked as complete: Buy groceries
```

### 6. View Tasks to See Completion Status

```bash
python src/main.py list
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Your Tasks:

[✓] 1: Buy groceries
[ ] 2: Write report (Quarterly sales report)
```

### 7. Update Task

```bash
python src/main.py update 1 --description "Weekly shopping list"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Task updated successfully.
ID: 1
Title: Buy groceries
Description: Weekly shopping list
```

### 8. Delete Task

```bash
python src/main.py delete 2
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Task deleted successfully: Write report
```

### 9. Verify Task Deleted

```bash
python src/main.py list
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Your Tasks:

[✓] 1: Buy groceries (Weekly shopping list)
```

## Common Workflows

### Creating Multiple Tasks

```bash
python src/main.py add "Task 1"
python src/main.py add "Task 2" --description "Details for task 2"
python src/main.py add "Task 3"
```

### Managing Task Lifecycle

```bash
# Create task
python src/main.py add "Complete project"

# Update task
python src/main.py update 1 --title "Complete project by Friday"

# Mark complete
python src/main.py complete 1

# View progress
python src/main.py list

# Delete when done
python src/main.py delete 1
```

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Run Specific Test File

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_task.py
pytest tests/integration/test_cli.py
```

### Run Tests with Verbose Output

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Common Issues

### Task Not Found Error

**Problem**:
```
Error: Task not found: 999
```

**Solution**: Verify the task ID exists by running `python src/main.py list` first.

### Empty Title Error

**Problem**:
```
Error: Title is required and cannot be empty or whitespace only.
```

**Solution**: Provide a non-empty title when using the `add` command.

### Invalid Task ID Error

**Problem**:
```
Error: Invalid task ID: abc
```

**Solution**: Task IDs must be integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

## Understanding the Application

### In-Memory Storage

All tasks are stored in memory only. When you stop and restart the application, all tasks are lost. This is by design for Phase I.

### Data Persistence

There is no file or database persistence. Task data exists only while the application is running.

### Task IDs

Task IDs are sequential integers starting from 1. IDs are never reused, even after deletion.

### Command Structure

All commands follow this pattern:
```
python src/main.py <command> [arguments]
```

Use `python src/main.py help` to see all available commands.

## Next Steps

Once comfortable with basic usage:

1. Read [spec.md](./spec.md) to understand all features
2. Review [data-model.md](./data-model.md) to understand task structure
3. Check [contracts/cli-interface.md](./contracts/cli-interface.md) for complete command reference
4. Review [research.md](./research.md) for technical decisions

## Development Quickstart

For developers contributing to this codebase:

1. Read [plan.md](./plan.md) for implementation stages
2. Follow [tasks.md](./tasks.md) (generated by `/sp.tasks`) for atomic tasks
3. Run tests frequently: `pytest tests/`
4. Follow Constitution principles in [constitution.md](../../.specify/memory/constitution.md)

## Getting Help

For any command, use:

```bash
python src/main.py help
```

Or get help for specific command (when implemented):

```bash
python src/main.py add --help
python src/main.py list --help
```

## Notes

- This is Phase I of the Todo CLI application
- All data is in-memory and lost on application restart
- No authentication, cloud sync, or persistent storage in this phase
- Commands are case-sensitive
- Task IDs are sequential and never reused
