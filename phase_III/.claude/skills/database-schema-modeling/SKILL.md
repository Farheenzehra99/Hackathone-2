# Database Schema Modeling Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- Relational database schema design  
- Multi-user data isolation required  
- ORM (SQLModel) based access  
- Performance and data integrity are important

## How This Skill Works

1. Identify entities: tables and ownership  
2. Define relationships: foreign keys and constraints  
3. Apply field constraints: required, optional  
4. Add indexes for query performance  
5. Enforce user-level isolation

## Output Format

- Table Definitions  
- Field Constraints  
- Relationships  
- Indexes and Performance Notes

## Quality Criteria

- Data ownership enforced at DB level  
- Invalid states impossible  
- Queries scale efficiently  
- ORM mapping is clean and predictable
